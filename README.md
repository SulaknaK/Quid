As part of a class UI/UX project, We designed an improved cashier system for Virginia Techâ€™s Owens Food Hall. 
The project involved conducting interviews with cashiers and store managers to understand their issues and workflow challenges. 
Based on these insights, We developed a user-centered redesign aimed at enhancing efficiency, reducing errors, and improving the overall experience for both staff and customers.
